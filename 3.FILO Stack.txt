we want to implement a Stack class, so the requirements are:

Limit the size of the stack.
Add element. 
Remove element. 
Check what was the last element. 
Get the current size of the stack.
Have a class that can accept any data type.
When the customer exceeds the size of the Stack, we need to throw an appropriate exception.
